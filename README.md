The project aims to reflect on the current global state of emergency, marked by the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The public is invited to enter a virtual mirror space where visual artefacts are superimposed. Like a sort of rudimentary social-media video filter, the digital effects revolve around the observerâ€™s face and movements. But instead of pink hearts or rabbit ears, the virtual debris looks tiny and abstract, more like an aura of digital micro-organisms and pathogens.
The work wishes to invite to reflection on digital privacy and personal space, but also on the mainstream media-induced fear of the disease, the social distancing recommendations / rules, which ultimately lead one to see the other person as a potential threat to their health and wellbeing.
Participants are invited to record videos and talk about their own COVID-19 experience, thoughts or concerns. With their consent, these videos will be featured in an online gallery as part of the project.
